# mail-to-mp3
**This is the first working version, I would like to change a lot of things later (reasons in the TODO section).**  
With this script you can log into your email account and download mp3 from mails which contains YouTube links or Shazam urls.
## Usage
Get FFmpeg. Install it system wide, put the executables in your PATH or simply put the binaries next to the script.  
Set environment variables:
- ```MAIL2MP3_USER```: email address
- ```MAIL2MP3_PASS```: password for the email
There are some more optional, you can find them on the code.
## TODO
I wanna rewrite the code for:
- better structuring
- better settings handling (json)
- better logging
